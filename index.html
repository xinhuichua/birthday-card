        <p><small>Hey Jia wen, I know I am 1 day late. So this is a random digital card that i got inspired online. 
            As a women in stem, i think we can do our part to be environmentally friendly by providing a paperless card. 
            Hence, i think you should stop using a mineral water bottle and get a water bottle.
            Anyway, happy belated birthday! We know each other since primary school and now we are at SMU.
            Even though sometimes i cannot stand you but i can't deny that you are a good friend.
            I hope you like this card and have a great day ahead!
            Stop being delulu and get a boyfriend soon!
